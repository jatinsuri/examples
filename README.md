# The Examples project

This project contains several examples to try out new things. The project itself is an example of how to setup a development setup.

## 1. Project Setup

Here are the steps to create a quick project mainly targetting java development using gradle for builds and eclipse as an IDE.

Create a template gradle project:
```
gradle init --type java-library
```

Create a useful gitignore file (gitignore.io):
```
gi java,eclipse,gradle
```

Initialize a empty git repo and make an initial commit:
```
git init
git add .
```
